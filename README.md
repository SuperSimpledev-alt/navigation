Hello readers.

I've created a basic navigation that includes a Logo and some lists where, if you click on the "product" you can view a drop down container [ Not very pretty looking :) ]

This Navigation is responsive.
so, on a mobile device you'll have a burger icon where on if you click, the navigation will slide in.

Feel free to use the source code and have fun with it by appliying the changes of your choice.

The source code is very simple and beginner friendly and contains just a bit of javascript.

* I will be updating this more frequently.
